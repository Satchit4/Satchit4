## Code-Driven Projects
- **Adaptive kMC for Crystal Morphology (C++)** — Physics-informed, thermodynamics-aware kMC across growth regimes; captured dual roles of crystal modifiers for better morphology prediction.
- **Multiscale DRM Catalyst Deactivation (C++/Python + HPC)** — Coupled kMC, mesoscopic, and macroscopic solvers; coarse time-stepping cut runtime from 17 days to 6 hours while preserving coke formation fidelity.
- **CFD–PBM Bubble Column Solver (OpenFOAM)** — Coupled CFD with population balance modeling to reach ~99% accuracy on bubble size distribution; evaluated breakage/coalescence kernels.
- **CFD–DEM Tablet Coater (OpenFOAM + LIGGGHTS)** — Simulated heat and mixing in rotating drums; quantified drum speed and air temperature effects to guide pharmaceutical coating settings.
- **Slug Flow in Annular Micro-Pipes (ANSYS Fluent)** — Modeled multiphase slug flow to study contact angle and velocity impacts on regime stability for micro-reactor designs.
- **Direct Air Capture Module for Aviation (COMSOL)** — Designed and simulated a DAC prototype integrated with aircraft flow; optimized skin friction and module placement under flight conditions.
- **Photo-Catalytic Micro-Reactor (COMSOL)** — Modeled continuous-flow micro-reactors to boost photo-catalytic degradation yields via ALD-informed surface design.
